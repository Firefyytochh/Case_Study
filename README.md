Case Study: Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction
This case study focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female patients of Pima Indian heritage based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset, provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and available on Kaggle, includes features such as glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and blood pressure.

The primary goal is to use this data to train a classification model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes. This case study serves as a practical application of supervised learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and health-related predictive analytics.
